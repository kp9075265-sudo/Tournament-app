Tournament App - Ready-to-Build Flutter Source
==================================================
What this bundle contains
- lib/main.dart        -> Main Flutter app (registration, tournaments, join, mock payments)
- pubspec.yaml         -> Required dependencies
- README.md            -> This file

IMPORTANT:
- I cannot produce an APK from this environment, but this source is ready for you to build locally
  or in a CI environment (instructions below).
- The app includes a placeholder for Razorpay payment integration (instructions included).
- The app uses local in-memory storage (no backend). I included comments where you'd wire a real backend (Firebase / Node / PHP).

How to build an APK (on your PC)
1) Install Flutter SDK: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2) In a terminal:
   flutter create tournament_app
   cd tournament_app
   (replace the generated pubspec.yaml and lib/main.dart with the ones in this bundle)
3) Get packages:
   flutter pub get
4) Build debug APK:
   flutter build apk --debug
   or release APK:
   flutter build apk --release
5) The APK will be at:
   build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

Adding payment gateway (Razorpay example)
- Add dependency in pubspec.yaml: razorpay_flutter: ^1.5.0
- For Android, update AndroidManifest and add the Razorpay key/credentials per Razorpay docs:
  https://razorpay.com/docs/payment-gateway/flutter-integration/
- The app includes a placeholder function `startPayment()` in main.dart with comments showing where to call Razorpay APIs.
- If you prefer Stripe or Paytm, follow their Flutter integration guides and replace the payment placeholder.

If you'd like, I can instead produce a full Firebase-backed version (with authentication, Firestore, cloud functions)
or create a CI workflow that builds the APK for you. Tell me which and I'll provide the files/instructions.
